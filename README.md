# Wee-Sketchy-McPadster

This is my solution for the Odin Project's JavaScript/jQuery project. You can view the assignment sheet [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/javascript-and-jquery?ref=lnav)

The goal is to build something like an Etch-A-Sketch: a grid of square divs that change color when you mouse over them, leaving behind a trail for pixelated doodling.
